Welcome!

Use `make install` to install the game from source, `make start` to see the main menu.

The list of games:<br />
1) brain-even<br />
2) brain-calc<br />
3) brain-gcd<br />
4) brain-balanc<br />
5) brain-progression<br />
6) brain-prime<br />

You can also install the game via **npm**. Just enter `$ npm install [-g] brain-games-primary`.<br />
Now you can call the menu via `npm start brain-games` or simple `brain-games`. <br />
To immediately start the specific game without a menu, use its name exactly as it is written above the line.
